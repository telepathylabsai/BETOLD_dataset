**BETOLD** (Breakdown Expectation for Task-Oriented Long Dialogs) is a
task-oriented dialog dataset, derived from real conversations between system
and user in order to fulfill the task of booking an appointment.
The aim of the dataset is to predict **LUFHs**, i.e. **user-initiated (U) forward calls (F)
and hang-ups (H) that happen in a late (L) point of the conversation**.
This dataset is characterized by NLG and NLU intents and entities.
It does not provide textual utterances.

workshop `When creative AI meets conversational AI <https://sites.google.com/view/cai-workshop-2022>`_.
(Paper will be released soon)

Dataset
******************

Dataset Features
==================

All dialogs include:

* LUHF: binary label 'luhf' or 'not_luhf'.
* utterances_annotations: contains all NLU and NLG intents and entities.

  * caller_name: indicates if it is a NLU (i.e a user input) or NLG (i.e a system input).
  * intent: the purpose which the speaker wants to achieve.
  * entities: slots extracted from NLU and NLG giving context to the conversation.


Structure
==================

The dataset is structured in the following way:

 .. code-block:: bash

  [
    {
      "LUHF": "luhf", # binary label 'luhf' or 'not_luhf'
      "utterances_annotations": [ # list of interactions between system and human
        {
          "caller_name": "nlg",
          "intent": "intro_assistant_1",
          "entities": [
            {
              "entity": "recording_warning"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "caller_name": "nlg",
          "intent": "intro_assistant_2",
          "entities": [
          ]
        },
        {
          "caller_name": "nlu",
          "intent": "schedule",
          "entities": [
          ]
        },
        # ...
      ]
    },
    # ...
  ]
